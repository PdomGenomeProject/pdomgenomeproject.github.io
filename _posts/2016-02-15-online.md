We recently received word that our manuscript describing the *Polistes dominula* genome project has been accepted at *Molecular Ecology*.
Today, the paper became [available online](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13578/abstract)!
The process of final proof editing, typesetting, and pagination is not yet complete, but we're happy that we're almost there!
